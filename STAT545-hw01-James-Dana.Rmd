#Concluding Thoughts
I incorporated all of these changes to this README.md file by editing in RMarkdown. I pulled, edited locally, saved, committed, and pushed to github.com.

It was super helpful to have Jenny's walkthrough for this assignment, along with the raw code. I relied on it a lot. I also did my own Googling to find other helpful cheatsheets and tips for coding. In particular, I was having trouble creating a bulleted list, which I remembered as being very basic and easy in class. The means used by Jenny (which Vincenzo also used in class) weren't working for me for some reason. I found a different suggestion to use an asterisk and plus signs, and that seemed to work OK.
